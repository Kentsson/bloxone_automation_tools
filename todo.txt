Assume xyz is company name and that the script is invoked as python
b1td-poc-setup -n companyname -a pub.lic.ip.add/32
 
- Configure a pass and block list with name of xyz-pass, xyz-block one bogus
entry in each. 
- Create a content filter with the Risk/Fraud category and
information/communication 
- Create an app filter with the Personal Storage
category 
- Create an external network with address specified in command line
- Create a policy with xyz and all of the above, plus a list of default feeds. 

If you add two, I can modify the script and lengthen the list to include the
complete set and actions that I recommend
